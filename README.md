# **Reader: Online Library Simulator** ðŸ“š

**Reader** is an online library system simulator developed as **portfolio Project** for the **ALX Software Engineering Program**. This project showcases my ability to build scalable, user-friendly web applications using modern technologies. The application allows students to manage their library activities, such as borrowing and returning books, while providing admins with powerful tools to manage users, books, and categories.
